* B.S. in Maritime Studies, Nanyang Technological University, 2012

Research
======
* Graduate Research Assistant (01/2020 - present) @ University College Dublin
    * Research on Explainable AI and Time Series Analysis under supervision of Dr. Georgiana Ifrim
    * Investigate Reliability and Robustness of post-hoc Deep Learning based XAI methods in Time Series Classification tasks
    * Devise model-agnostic evaluation metrics to evaluate, measure, and compare quality of explanation across XAI algorithms


Work Experiences
======
* Data Analyst (08/2018 - 07/2019) @ [Trusting Social](https://trustingsocial.com/)
    * Researched and enhanced accuracy of Credit Score V2 model, achieving Gini coefficient of 0.65-0.95 on backtesting datasets
    * Conducted data preparation, data quality monitoring, feature engineering, and hyper parameters tuning on 100TB+ dataset using PySpark
    * Evaluated, back-tested the Credit Scoring model; Advised optimal use of credit score for different products based on model back-test result
* Data Science Project (09/2017 - 05/2018) @ [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html)
    * Proposed the idea of combining machine learning techniques and time series analysis to make prediction
    * Gathered, cleaned, analyzed, engineered features from multiple sources to build predictive model that saved time and human efforts of doing manual budgeting
    * Delivered a prediction model using Random Forest and Time Series Analysis that achieved Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) of under 5% on 3-month data test data
    
* Research Assistant (08/2016 - 05/2018) @ [Arizona State University](https://edplus.asu.edu/projects/asu-online)
    * Performed large-scale data pre-processing and visualization on edX database with Python and R
    * Explored behavior-based patterns driving metrics using principal component analysis and factor analysis
    * Conducted feature importance analysis with Random Forest and Logistics Regression based on success metrics such as course completion and student retention
* Analyst (09/2012 - 06/2016) @ [Shun Shing Group](https://ssgil.com/)
    *  Led a market research analyst team to analyze, predict, and offer future prices to commodity traders
    *  Designed experiments to diagnose features driving contract pricing; Performed hypothesis testing of the independent variables to confirm statistical significance
    *  Proposed, researched, and implemented use of Monte Carlo simulation and Stochastic process in price modeling and scenario analysis using @RISK
