Outside research, I consider myself a believer and continuous learner. 
I believe that the capability of growth in human beings is not limited by age, qualifications, or job titles. 
The more we *learn*, the more we *know*, the more humble and the less discriminative we will be. 
True personal development brings us wider perspectives, enables us making positive net impact, and lets us live a life with more freedom and happiness.

In this section, I want to continuously update the articles/lectures/talks/podcasts/any other media forms that profoundly shape my sense of [why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/) 
and my journey of learning, growing, and becoming a better version of myself.
